Automatically replace your posts' keywords on your website with an internal link and tooltip. 

== Description ==

A lightweight SEO tool we use for internal linkbuilding in our knowledge base, but can be adapted to your needs. For every post you can assign a keyword that will be replaced on your website with an internal link and a tooltip with features image, if so desired. 

== Features ==
* Auto-replace keywords with internal links. (Dynamically - not permanently)
* Calculates how many times a keyword exists in your post content.
* Only replaces one word per page.
* Does not replace in H1-6 elements. Only in post content.
* You can use a tooltip with or without featured image.

= Support =
