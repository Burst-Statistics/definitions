Automatically replace your posts' keywords on your website with an internal link and tooltip. 

== Description ==

A lightweight SEO tool we use for internal linkbuilding in our knowledge base, but can be adapted to your needs. For every post you can assign a keyword that will be replaced on your website with an internal link and a tooltip with features image, if so desired. 

== Features ==
* Auto-replace keywords with internal links. (Dynamically - not permanently)
* Calculates how many times a keyword exists in your post content.
* Only replaces one word per page.
* Does not replace in H1-6 elements. Only in post content.
* You can use a tooltip with or without featured image.

= How it works =
For every post on your website you can designate a keyword. That keyword will than be auto-replaced in the content by a hoverable link with tooltip, if so desired.

= Example =

As a use case for Complianz.io; we have a custom post type "Definitions", every definition explains a keyword in more detail. If we use "Cookie Policy" on our website, this word will be underlined as a tooltip and on hover will show a infobox with an internal link to this definition. [Example](https://complianz.io/customizing-the-cookie-policy-templates/)
